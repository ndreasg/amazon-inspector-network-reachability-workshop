You have successfully configured Inspector and started an assessment. This assessment can take up to 15 minutes, so now’s a good time for you to review the architecture. The [Presentation](./assets/demo-support-presentation.pdf) includes the architecture diagram, the route tables, and the security groups. The [Presentation Notes](presentation-notes.md) page then walks through the architecture with some probing questions.

You can also choose to skip to [Evaluating Findings](03-evaluate-findings.md) once the report is complete.
